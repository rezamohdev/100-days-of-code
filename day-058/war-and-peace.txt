WAR AND PEACE
By Leo Tolstoy / Tolstoi
BOOK ONE: 1805

CHAPTER I
â€œWell, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.But I warn you, if you donâ€™t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichristâ€”I really believe he is Antichristâ€”I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my â€˜faithful slave, â€™ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened youâ€”sit down and tell me all the news.â€
